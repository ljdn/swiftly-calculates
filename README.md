# TODO

- undo probably doesn't undo setting of variable
- UI only allows for one variable, M (does this even matter)
- EXTRA CREDIT: displayValue is Double? instead of Double
- EXTRA CREDIT: Use NSNumberFormatter to show 6 digits after decimal and no .0 for int
- EXTRA CREDIT: Button to generate random number between 0 and 1
